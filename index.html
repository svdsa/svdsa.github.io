        <p>(Everyone's welcome at every venue!  This isn't a request that
          <strong>[MV]</strong> events just be attended by Mountain View
          residents.  It's only intended as a useful shorthand to help you if
          you're trying to plan out your week.)</p>
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          An (unofficial) local chapter of the <a href="http://www.dsausa.org/">
          DSA</a>!  We're a group of residents of San Mateo, Menlo Park, Palo
          Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Sunnyvale, and other neighboring
          towns.  By coming together, we can bolster and create initiatives that
          make life easier and more equitable for our slice of the Bay Area and
          beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get a sense of how the DSA operates as a national organization,
          and how SVDSA might relate to that national organization, check out
          the <a href="https://dsaspringplatform.org/">Spring Platform</a>.  It
          provides a good sense of our strategic and tactical goals: how to
          handle growth from new members in a "vibrant, democratic" fashion, and
          how to ensure "transparent and accountable structures of leadership
          and decision-making."

        <h2>Meeting up</h2>
        <p>
          We're slowly organizing a set of standing meetings, but historically
          the SVDSA has met in Mountain View one of two ways:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Socializing</strong> at the St. Stephen's Green pub:
              meeting, mingling, hearing what's new and where everyone's at</li>
            <li><strong>Organizing</strong> at our General Meetings, typically
              held at the Mountain View Community Center.  Here we get deeper
              into plans for the near, medium, and long-term.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We're currently cementing a permanent routine for these SVDSA specific
          events. In the meantime, check out our calendar below, and follow our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/svdsa">Facebook</a> and
