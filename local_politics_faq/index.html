                I want to get involved as a citizen in politics.

              <br/>
              Your legislative representation has three major levels: national,
              state, and city/municipal. Each has jurisdiction over different
              levels of topics of interest, so targeting the appropriate level
              becomes important for advocating for social change. You can check
              out our SVDSA Local Politics Primer (link soon to come) for
              contact information for all levels, and read on in the FAQ for
              more details.

                What is the easiest way to look up my local representatives?
              </strong>
              <br/>
              California provides a convenient tool:
              <a href="http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/">
                Find Your California Representative.
              </a>
              After entering in your address, it should provide links to
              your representatives for the State Assembly and State Senate.
              <br/><br/>
              Your representatives for the US Senate are
              <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/">
                Kamala D. Harris
              </a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/">
                Dianne Feinstein.

              <strong>
                What is the best way to keep track of recent/active bills in
                the California legislature?
              </strong>
              <br/>
              The best place to start is the official resource:
              <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov">
                leginfo.legislature.ca.gov.
              </a>
              On the Bill Information tab, choose a keyword to search or enter
              the bill number. On the California Law tab, you’ll find the state
              constitution and various codes written into law. What you won’t
              find are things run by either the national or municipal levels,
              so topics like building more housing tend to show up in city code.

                What is the basic California legislative process?
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Please start by checking out the senate's
              <a href="http://senate.ca.gov/legislativeprocess">
                guide to the legislative process
              </a>.
              <p>
                Very generally, each bill starts in one house or the other,
                i.e., the senate or the assembly, goes through a series of
                sessions that depend on what the bill entails, and if it passes
                it will go before the other house. If the bill passes both
                houses, the governor can either veto the bill or sign it into
                law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the senate and assembly have sessions that have a section
                in which the public may participate to give comments and
                suggestions. If used effectively, eloquently, and timely, and
                more often than not in a group of people rather than
                individually, writing to and meeting with legislators and
                attending these sessions can be great places to voice your
                stance on bills before the bill is heard in front of each house.
              </p>
              <p>
                To participate in the hearing sessions, you can check out the
                <a href="http://www.calchannel.com/video-on-demand/">
                  California Channel
                </a> to get a feel for the flow of the hearings and then go
                speak in front of the
                <a href="http://senate.ca.gov/committees">senate committees</a>
                or
                <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/committees">

              <strong>What is the basic municipal process?</strong>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Similar to the state level, each city or municipality will have
                a space for citizens to interact as they come together to
                decide and enact policy. Each of these local entities will
                have their own structure, but generally they have a city
                council and several boards or commissions that advise the
                council.
              </p>
              <p>
                Citizens can interact with the commissions, e.g., planning
                commission, during their meetings on specific topics and with
                more depth on the topic (no policy decision), or more broadly
                to the city council (possible policy decision). Often these
                meetings are televised, so you can check out the city’s
                website to watch past meetings and get a feel for the flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic structure of a city council meeting is:
                <ol>
                  <li>public comment not on agenda</li>
                  <li>list agenda</li>
                  <li>presentation by city staff on each agenda item</li>
                  <li>clarifying questions asked by officials</li>
                  <li>public comment for agenda item</li>
                  <li>officials discuss decision (if any).</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                This gives two places for citizens to comment.

              <strong>
                When I get a call-to-action for contacting my legislator about
                a bill, who do I contact?
              </strong>
              <br/>
              Here’s a simple trick: if the bill starts with "S": then US
              senate,  "HR": US house of reps, "SB": California senate, "AB":
              California assembly. At later stages of each bill, the other house
              will vote, e.g., the state assembly will vote on SB562 after it
              passes the senate.
