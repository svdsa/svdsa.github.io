      <h1>Local Judicial Politics</h1>

      <div id="judicial">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          On the local level, Judges are elected to six year terms. 
          They are locally divided into two court houses:
          <a href="http://www.scscourt.org/general_info/jo/judicial_officers.shtml">
            Santa Clara County
          </a>
          (sixth district; 89 Justices) and
          <a href="http://www.sanmateocourt.org/general_info/judges/directory.php">
            San Mateo County
          </a>
          (first district; 29 Justices).
        </p>
        <h2>Elections</h2>
        <p>
          The Attorney General is elected for four year terms
          (and the current term ends in 2018), with a cap of two such terms. 
          Santa Clara County provides information on
          <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/rov/Info/Documents/Office-Holders-List.pdf">
            when its judges will face re-election.
          </a>
        </p>
        <h2>How Judicial Policy is Formed</h2>
        <p>
          The policy-making body of California courts is the judicial council
          headed by the Chief Justice of California.
          The council has 6-8 business meeting which normally allow for public
          comments (unless stated otherwise).
          Additional information about how the courts function can be found at:
          <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov">www.courts.ca.gov</a>
          (including listing of task forces and public meetings).
        </p>
        <h2>How can judges be removed from office?</h2>
        <p>
          The Commission on Judicial Performance investigates complaints made
          against judges of the Superior Court, the Court of Appeal, and the
          Supreme Court. Further, the Commission accepts written Public
          complaints (with no support for online submissions).
          The address and guidelines for complaints can be found at
          <a href="https://cjp.ca.gov/file_a_complaint/">
            cjp.ca.gov/file_a_complaint/
          </a>.
          If found to be guilty of judicial misconduct, the commission can
          discipline a judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, Judges can be recalled if an amount of signatures is
          collected that surpasses twenty percent of the votes cast for the
          judge in the last election.
          And if the judge had not appeared on the last election, recall
          signatures need to equal twenty percent
          “of votes cast for whichever countywide office received the least
          total number of votes in the most recent general election in the
          judge's county”.
        </p>
